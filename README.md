# Project Analysis and Design
# Surround AI

Surround AI is the python framework which is designed for flexible usage in Artificial Intelligence(AI). It is designed to support data scientist in their progress. Each and every scientist use different algorithm to solve different problems. There are no standard way for them to analyse altogether in a single module. To provide a standard solution surround frame work is built. Evolution of machine learning pipeline is not possible without re-constructing the coding whereas surround package will provide a pipeline without any alterations.

# Usage

**#** Helping the data scientists in analytics instead of using glue codes for their research.

**#** Easy interaction between several machine learning pipelines.

**#** Provides end-to-end solution instead of providing solution for the models.

##  Current
Using cloud API for the upcoming training model.

Developing a pipeline for the system using algorithms of machine learning.
## Switch to another file

All your files are listed in the file explorer. You can switch from one to another by clicking a file in the list.

## Aim

To identify the drivers who are breaking the road rules with the help of AI(Artificial Intelligence).
**(Note: The system pipeline for this app is strictly under development.)**


## Method

**#** Taking the photo of the car on the mobile application

**#** Storing the image for the process.

**#** Sending the notification to the authorities API (note: Check the availability of the access to API)

**#** Integrating with AWS’s recognition API for reading car number plates.

**#** Again notifies the Authorities for the infringement notice.

## Installation guide:

**Windows:**

**#** 	Install the python 3.7.3 in the system.

**#** 	Pip3 is installed in your system by default when you install Python.

**#** 	Set paths for both in Environment variables.

**#** 	Open command prompt.

**#** 	Type  python  to ensure that python is successfully installed in your system.

**#** 	Then type exit() to get out from python environment.

**#**   Then type pip3 install surround.

**#** 	Surround is installed in system. To ensure type surround –h. It shows all necessary commands of surround.


## Conclusion:

Surround is under development which as goals to satisfy the needs of data scientists. It completely turns the view of analysing in machine learning and other concepts of AI(Artificial Intelligence).
